Total time required: approx. 4 hours.

## BMI score visualization

Demo directly available at https://patrick-radulian.github.io/tractive-challenge/

Tractive offers a web application that lets you calculate the BMI of your pet. The BMI
calculation itself is already implemented.

Your task is to implement a small widget/component (in the web technology of your choice)
to visualize the BMI score in a nice way.

For the sake of simplicity we assume that the BMI score can only take a value between 0
and 120. If the score is below 30 then the pet is underweight. If the score is above 90 the
pet is overweight.
